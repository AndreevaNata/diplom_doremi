Warning: Torch did not find available GPUs on this system.
 If your intention is to cross-compile, this is not an error.
By default, Apex will cross-compile for Pascal (compute capabilities 6.0, 6.1, 6.2),
Volta (compute capability 7.0), Turing (compute capability 7.5),
and, if the CUDA version is >= 11.0, Ampere (compute capability 8.0).
If you wish to cross-compile for a single specific architecture,
export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="compute capability" before running setup.py.
